             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Social Media IRL</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             I’ve given up social media for the New Year and am trying to make friends outside Facebook 
             while  applying the same principles. Every day, I walk down the street and tell passersby 
             what I’ve eaten, how I feel, what I did the night before, and what I will do tomorrow. Then
              I give them pictures of my family, my dog, and me gardening. I also listen to their conversations 
              and tell them I love them. And it works. I already have three people following me—two  police
               officers and a psychiatrist.
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Spotted on Facebook</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             <b> Student:</b>   I don’t understand why my grade was so low. How did  I do on my research paper?   <br/><br/>
             <b> Teacher:</b>Teacher: Actually, you didn’t turn in a research paper. You turned in a random assemblage
              of sentences. In fact, the  sentences you apparently  kidnapped in the dead of night  and forced into 
              this violent and arbitrary plan of yours clearly seemed to be placed on the pages against their will. 
              Reading your paper was like watching unfamiliar, uncomfortable people interacting at a cocktail party 
              that no one wanted to attend in the first place. You didn’t submit a research paper. You submitted a
              hostage situation.

             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Is Your Boss This Dumb?</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             While taking stock of our  products, I read aloud the final  numbers to my boss. As he entered each one into
              a calculator, I deleted it off my mobile device. Only after  I’d finished did we realize that he had entered 
              the numbers on his  desk phone’s keypad.

             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Flash Drive Failure</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             I’m at the library, and for some reason, when I plug my flash drive into the computer, it doesn’t show up. I
              keep trying, but nothing happens. As an IT major, I know I can figure this out. So I spend 15 minutes changing
               settings and inserting and removing the flash drive. Then a girl sitting next to me taps my shoulder and says,
                “You’re plugging into my computer, not yours.”

             I can still remember a time when I knew more than my phone.

                Mom: Your great-aunt just passed away. LOL.
                <br/>
                Son: Why is that funny?
                <br/>
                Mom: It’s not funny, David! What do you mean?
                <br/>
                Son: Mom, LOL means Laughing Out Loud.
                <br/>
                Mom: I thought it meant Lots  of Love. I have to call everyone back.

                Daughter: I got an A in Chemistry.

                Mom: WTF!
                <br/>
                Daughter: Mom, what do you think WTF means?
                <br/>
                Mom: Well That’s Fantastic.
                <br/>
                ~
                Mom: What do IDK, LY & TTYL mean?
                <br/>
                Son: I don’t know, love you, talk to you later.
                <br/>
                Mom: OK, I will ask your sister.
