             <p style="color:green;">
             While on patrol, I arrested a burglar who’d injured himself running from a home. He told me he’d broken in
              and unhooked the phone before searching for valuables. But he’d panicked when he heard a woman’s voice. I 
              entered the house and heard the same voice: “If you’d like to make a call, please hang up and try your call again.”

             <p style="color:green;">
             The James Bond film Spectre opens in November. Writer Peter  Anspach explains how he’d improve his odds if he were a film villain.
            <br/><br/>
            • I will not fly into a rage and  kill a messenger who brings me  bad news just to illustrate how evil  I am. Good messengers are hard  to come by.
            <br/><br/>
            • My vats of hazardous chemicals will be covered when not in use. Also, I will not construct walkways above them.
            <br/><br/>
            • If I’m eating dinner with the hero, put poison in his goblet, then have  to leave the table for any reason,  I will order new drinks for both  of us instead of trying to decide whether to switch with him.
            <br/><br/>
            • My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.
            <br/><br/>
            • When I’ve captured my adversary and he says, “Look, before you kill me, will you at least tell me what this is all about?” I’ll say no and finish him off.

             I’m at the library, and for some reason, when I plug my flash drive into the computer, it doesn’t show up. I
              keep trying, but nothing happens. As an IT major, I know I can figure this out. So I spend 15 minutes changing
               settings and inserting and removing the flash drive. Then a girl sitting next to me taps my shoulder and says,
                “You’re plugging into my computer, not yours.”

             <p style="color:green;">
             My husband was driving  home from work when he was  pulled over for not wearing a seat belt. Two days later—same ticket, same cop.
            <br/><br/>
            “So,” the officer said, “have you learned anything?”
            <br/><br/>
            “Yes, I have,” said my husband. “I’ve learned I need to take a  different way home from work.”

             <p style="color:green;">
                “How many times have you  committed suicide?”<br/>
                “Were you alone or by yourself?”<br/>
                “Was it you or your brother who was killed?”<br/>
                “Without saying anything, tell the jury what you did next.”<br/>
                “Was that the same nose you broke as a child?”<br/>
                “Now, doctor, isn’t it true that when a person dies in his sleep,  he doesn’t know about it until the next morning?”<br/>
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Security System</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
            When a neighbor’s home was burglarized, I decided to be more safety conscious. But my measly front-door lock wasn’t going to
             stop anyone, so I hung this sign outside: “Nancy, don’t come in. The snake is loose. Mom.”
