             <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Modeled On Confusion</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             The photographer was positioning my new husband and me for  our wedding photos when he asked, “Have you ever modeled?”
             <br><br>
            My cheeks instantly turned red. “No, I haven’t,” I said. “But I always thought …”
            <br><br>
            The photographer interrupted me: “I meant him.”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Wearing Husband Goggles</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             The party’s host paid me a great compliment. “You are a good-looking woman,” he said. “Honest—I’ve had only one beer.”
             <br><br>
            My glow was only slightly dimmed when my husband interjected, “Imagine how great she’ll look after two.”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Is Your Boss This Dumb?</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             While taking stock of our  products, I read aloud the final  numbers to my boss. As he entered each one into
              a calculator, I deleted it off my mobile device. Only after  I’d finished did we realize that he had entered 
              the numbers on his  desk phone’s keypad.
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">A Woman Shoots Her Husband For Stepping On The Clean Floor…</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             A police officer jumps into his squad car and calls the station.
             <br><br>
            “I have an interesting case here,” he says. “A woman shot her husband for stepping on the floor she just mopped.”
            <br><br>
            “Have you arrested her?” asks the sergeant.
            <br><br>
            “No, not yet. The floor’s still wet.”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">A Real Gut-Buster</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
            A woman noticed her husband standing on the bathroom scale, sucking in his stomach. “Ha­­! That’s not going to help,” she said.
            <br><br>
            “Sure, it does,” he said. “It’s the only way I can see the numbers.”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Bonnie McFarlane On The Key To A Good Marriage</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
               I once gave my husband the  silent treatment for an entire week, at the end of which he declared, 
               “Hey, we’re getting along pretty great lately!”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Why You Should Make Love Once A Year</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
           A therapist has a theory that couples who make love once a day are the happiest. So he tests it at a seminar by asking those assembled, “How many people here make love once a day?” Half the people raise their hands, each of them grinning widely. “Once a week?” A third of  the audience members raise their hands, their grins a bit less vibrant. “Once a month?” A few hands tepidly go up. Then he asks, “OK, how about once a year?”
           <br><br>
            One man in the back jumps up and down, jubilantly waving his hands. The therapist is shocked—this disproves his theory. “If you make love only once a year,” he asks, “why are you so happy?”
            <br><br>
            The man yells, “Today’s the day!”
