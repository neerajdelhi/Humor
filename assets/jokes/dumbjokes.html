             <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">The Dumbest Police Calls in America…</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             From the police blotter,  or, what a beat cop deals with  every day:
            <br/><br/>
            • A deputy responded to a report  of a vehicle stopping at mailboxes.  It was the mail carrier.
            <br/><br/>
            • A woman said her son was  attacked by a cat, and the cat would not allow her to take her son to the hospital.
            <br/><br/>
            • A resident said someone had  entered his home at night and taken five pounds of bacon. Upon further investigation, police discovered  his wife had gotten up for a late-night snack.
            <br/><br/>
            • A man reported that a squirrel  was running in circles on Davis Drive, and he wasn’t sure if it was sick or had been hit by a car. An  officer responded, and as he drove on the street, he ran over the squirrel.
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Spotted on Facebook</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             <b> Student:</b>   I don’t understand why my grade was so low. How did  I do on my research paper?   <br/><br/>
             <b> Teacher:</b>Teacher: Actually, you didn’t turn in a research paper. You turned in a random assemblage
              of sentences. In fact, the  sentences you apparently  kidnapped in the dead of night  and forced into 
              this violent and arbitrary plan of yours clearly seemed to be placed on the pages against their will. 
              Reading your paper was like watching unfamiliar, uncomfortable people interacting at a cocktail party 
              that no one wanted to attend in the first place. You didn’t submit a research paper. You submitted a
              hostage situation.

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Three Dumb ER Stories You’re Allowed To Laugh At</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             Patient in to ER at 0400 with no complaints: ‘I have been having chest pain for 4 months but I am not having chest pain now. 
             The reason I’m here now is because I heard that 4am is the best time to come cause there are not that many people.’ ”
             <br/><br/>
            “Had a woman call 911 because she ‘had déjà vu in the shower and got nervous.’”
            <br/><br/>
            “Got a frantic call from a woman who claimed she had overdosed and needed help immediately. We arrive on scene, and she hands us an 
            empty mint container, saying she took them all. That night she learned that you cannot overdose on mints.”

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">The Mystery Kitchen Utensil…</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
            My collection of vintage kitchen utensils includes one whose intended purpose was always a mystery. It looks like a cross between a metal slotted spoon and a spatula, so I  use it as both. When not in use, it  is prominently displayed in a  decorative ceramic utensil caddy  in my kitchen.
            <br/><br/>
            The mystery of the spoon/spatula was recently solved when I found one in its original packaging at  a rummage sale.
            <br/><br/>
            It’s a pooper-scooper.
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Time Zones Are Hard.</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             While I was out to lunch, my coworker answered my phone and told the caller that I would be back  in 20 minutes. 
             The woman asked,  “Is that 20 minutes Central Standard Time?”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Design Client From Hell: “Remove That Circle”</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
                Client: Please remove the unnecessary circle at the end of the sentence.
                <br/><br/>
                Me: You mean … the period?
                <br/><br/>
                Client: I don’t care what you designers call it; it is unsightly. Delete it.
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Why Can’t Coffee Shops Spell Correctly?</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
           When asked for his name by the coffee shop clerk, my brother-in-law answered, “Marc,
            with a C.” Minutes later, he was handed his coffee with his name written on the side: Cark.
