        <h3>Military Jokes</h3>
        
             <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Aged To Perfection</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             The average age of people living in our military retirement community is 85. Recently, a neighbor turned 100, and a big birthday party was thrown. Even his son turned up.
             <br><br>
            “How old are you?” a tenant asked.
            <br><br>
            “I’m 81 years old,” he answered.
                <br><br>
            The tenant shook her head. “They sure grow up fast, don’t they?”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">If You Need Something Done Wrong…</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             “Next time I send a damn fool,  I go myself.”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">The Deadliest Job in WWII</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             My high school assignment  was to ask a veteran about World War II. Since my father had served  in the Philippines during the war,  I chose him. After a few basic questions, I very gingerly asked, “Did you ever kill anyone?”
                <br><br>
            Dad got quiet. Then, in a soft voice, he said, “Probably. I was the cook.”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Never Lose A Tank</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             When I lost my rifle, the Army charged me $85. That’s why in the Navy, the captain goes down with the ship.
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Military Lesson: Never Volunteer</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             During basic training at Fort Leavenworth, our sergeant asked if anyone had  “artistic” abilities. 
             Having been an architectural draftsman in civilian life, I raised my hand. Then the  sergeant announced that 
             everyone would get a three-day pass … except me. I would stay behind and neatly print each soldier’s name onto 
             his Army-issued underwear.
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">A Vietnam Tupperware Party</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
                The steaming jungles of Vietnam were not my husband’s first choice  of places to spend his 21st birthday.
                 However, the mood was brightened when he received a birthday cake from his sister. It was carefully  encased 
                 in a Tupperware container and came with this note: “Dick, when you’re finished, can you mail back my container?”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">What are My Options?</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
            Scene: Me using the Siri app on my iPhone.
             <br/>
            Me: Siri, call my wife.
             <br/>
            Siri: Samantha McLaughlin is not in your contacts.
             <br/>
            Me: Samantha Gibbs is my wife.
             <br/>
            Siri: I’ve added Samantha Gibbs as your wife.
             <br/>
            Me: Call my wife.
             <br/>
            Siri: Which wife?
            </p>
