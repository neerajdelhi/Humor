             <p style="font-weight:600px;">A Fly-Killer’s Pickle</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             My three-year-old daughter stuck out her hand and said, “Look at the fly I killed, Mommy.” Since she was eating a juicy pickle at the time,  I thrust her contaminated hands under the faucet and washed them with antibacterial soap.
            After sitting her down to finish her pickle, I asked, with a touch of awe, “How did you kill that fly all by yourself?”
            Between bites, she said, “I hit it with my pickle.”

             <p style="font-weight:600px;">A Woman Shoots Her Husband For Stepping On The Clean Floor…</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             A police officer jumps into his squad car and calls the station.
             <br/><br/>
            “I have an interesting case here,” he says. “A woman shot her husband for stepping on the floor she just mopped.”
            <br/><br/>
            “Have you arrested her?” asks the sergeant.
            <br/><br/>
            “No, not yet. The floor’s still wet.”
            </p>

             <p style="font-weight:600px;">My Grandson Is A Smart Egg…</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             At the mall, my five-year-old grandson joined the other children in line waiting to sit on the Easter Bunny’s lap. When it was his turn, Jake didn’t move; he just stared.
             <br/><br/>
            “Don’t you want to sit on the  bunny’s lap?” I asked.
            <br/><br/>
            “No!” he shouted. “There’s  a man in his mouth!”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Bonnie McFarlane On The Key To A Good Marriage</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             I once gave my husband the  silent treatment for an entire week, at the end of which he declared, “Hey, we’re getting along
              pretty great lately!”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">My Kids Don’t Know What I Do</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             I can still remember a time when I knew more than my phone.
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">My Kids Don’t Know What I Do</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
                TI’ve been working on my PhD  in engineering for the past five years, but my kids don’t necessarily see that as work.
                As we were driving past Walmart one day, my son spotted a Now Hiring sign and suggested that I could get  a job there.
                <br/><br/>
                Hoping to make a point, I asked, “Do you think they’re looking for an engineer?”
                <br/><br/>
                “Oh, sure,” he said. “They’ll hire anybody.”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Married To The Job</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
           I guess this is what happens after you’ve worked at the same place for a while. I was eating at a fast-food
            restaurant when an employee began his shift by walking into the kitchen area and calling out, “Honey, I’m home!”
