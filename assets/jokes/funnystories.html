             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Life With A Blonde Teenager…</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
            <b>SCENE:</b> My teenage daughter and me in the car.
            <br/><br/>
           <b>Lauren:</b>  Dad, do you know what the most commonly used letter in a girl’s name is?
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Me:</b> Hmm, is it a consonant or a vowel? (Silence.) Please tell me you know what consonants and vowels are.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Lauren:</b> You’re no fun, Dad. Forget it.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Me:</b> What is a vowel?
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Lauren:</b> OK, OK. A vowel is … ahh … eh … well, oh … uh …
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Me:</b> Close enough.

             <p style="font-weight:600px;">What An Ugly Duck…</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             My husband was waterskiing when he fell into the river. As the boat  circled to pick him up, he noticed a hunter sitting
              in a duck boat in the reeds. My husband put his hands in the air and joked, “Don’t shoot!”
              <br/><br/>
            The hunter responded, “Don’t quack.”
            </p>

             <p style="color:green;">
             I’d never had surgery, and I was nervous. “This is a very simple, noninvasive procedure,” the anesthesiologist reassured me.
              I felt better, until … “Heck,” he continued, “you have  a better chance of dying from the  anesthesia than the surgery itself.”

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">A Fly-Killer’s Pickle</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
            My three-year-old daughter stuck out her hand and said, “Look at the fly I killed, Mommy.” Since she was eating a 
            juicy pickle at the time,  I thrust her contaminated hands under the faucet and washed them with antibacterial soap.<br/><br/>
After sitting her down to finish her pickle, I asked, with a touch of awe, “How did you kill that fly all by yourself?”
Between bites, she said, “I hit it with my pickle.”

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">Aged To Perfection</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
             The average age of people living in our military retirement community is 85. Recently, a neighbor turned 100, and a big birthday party was thrown. Even his son turned up.
             <br/><br/>
            “How old are you?” a tenant asked.
            <br/><br/>
            “I’m 81 years old,” he answered.
            <br/><br/>
            The tenant shook her head. “They sure grow up fast, don’t they?”
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">The Dumbest Police Calls in America…</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
                From the police blotter,  or, what a beat cop deals with  every day:
                 <br/><br/>
            • A deputy responded to a report  of a vehicle stopping at mailboxes.  It was the mail carrier.
             <br/><br/>
            • A woman said her son was  attacked by a cat, and the cat would not allow her to take her son to the hospital.
             <br/><br/>
            • A resident said someone had  entered his home at night and taken five pounds of bacon. Upon further investigation,
            police discovered  his wife had gotten up for a late-night snack.
             <br/><br/>
            • A man reported that a squirrel  was running in circles on Davis Drive, and he wasn’t sure if it was sick or had been
            hit by a car. An  officer responded, and as he drove on the street, he ran over the squirrel.
            </p>

            <hr style="width: 75%;">
             <p style="font-weight:600px;">A Place Where Grandkids Belong</p>
             <p style="color:green;">
            We were tearing down an  old three-seater outhouse when my neighbor asked if she could have the single-plank,
            three-hole outhouse seat. I said sure.<br/><br/>
            Six months later, she invited me  to her home. There she showed  off her newly designed family room, complete with a 
            single-plank,  three-hole picture frame featuring her three grandchildren.
